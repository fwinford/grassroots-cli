How you can help:

I'm sorry, but the information about the missions of the listed grassroots and nonprofit organizations is currently not available.
However, there are other local and national organizations that are working hard to address the issue of aggressive immigration raids and detentions in Los Angeles.

One such organization is the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA).
CHIRLA is a California leader with national impact made of diverse immigrant families and individuals who act as agents of social change to achieve a world with freedom of mobility, full human rights, and true participatory democracy.
They are based in Los Angeles and have been actively working to protect the rights of immigrants, including those who have been detained.

Another organization you might consider supporting is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California.
The ACLU works in courts, legislatures, and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.
They have been very active in advocating for the rights of immigrants and have been involved in legal actions against inhumane detention conditions.

Both of these organizations align with the cause of addressing aggressive immigration raids and detentions and are based in the Los Angeles area.
Your support can help them continue their important work.
Remember, every bit of help counts and your involvement can make a real difference.
